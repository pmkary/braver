# Braver
Braver is a tiny fork of [Brave](www.brave.com)'s [desktop browser](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop) containing what I want in my browser. Most changes will probably not be accepted by the brave team so I maintain a separate fork to myself.


# Changes
Changes are and shall be mostly towards UI. A brief change list is provided here to compare the two versions.

## Tabs
Tabs are the first things that I changed within the brave. Current version of Brave has a tab bar like this:

My version (Braver) has a tab bar much more like in Safari. More than changing the very shape it has pixel-perfect design fixes for the previous version.

# Legal
Brave is open source software under MPL which means having a fork is acceptable, however due to my respect towards the Brave brand's trademark I have changed the name to Braver so that it both respects the brand and it's trademark and still keeps it's relation to the original browser.

# Thanks
Thanks a lot to the brave team for the great browser.
